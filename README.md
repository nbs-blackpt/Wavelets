# Wavelet methods for Julia #
This code should eventually end up replicating the good parts of various implementations of wavelet methods in R and MATLAB that I have used.

## Done so far ##
Maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform works with HAAR filter.

## To be done ##
- Finish porting various filters for MODWT.
- Implement DWT.
- Implement MRA.

## Inspired by: ##
So far, the code is insipired by [wavelets package from R](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wavelets/index.html)
